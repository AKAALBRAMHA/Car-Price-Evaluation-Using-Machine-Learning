### **Dataset**
[Car Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zahrayazdani81/carsdataset)

### **Goal**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to evaluate the price of used cars based on various features. Accurate car price estimation is crucial for both buyers and sellers to make informed decisions in the automotive market. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to predict the price of a car considering factors such as the year of manufacture, current market price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and ownership history.

### **Problem Statement**
In the automotive industry, pricing a used car accurately can be a challenging task due to the numerous factors that influence its value. Traditional methods of car valuation rely heavily on expert knowledge and market trends, which can be subjective and inconsistent. This project aims to overcome these limitations by using data-driven techniques to create a reliable and objective car price evaluation model.

### **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains various features that are commonly considered when evaluating the price of a used car. The key features in the dataset include:

- **Year**: The year the car was manufactured.
- **Present_Price**: The current market price of the car.
- **Kms_Driven**: The total distance the car has been driven, measured in kilometers.
- **Fuel_Type**: The type of fuel used by the car (Petrol, Diesel, or Other).
- **Seller_Type**: Whether the seller is a dealer or an individual.
- **Transmission**: The type of transmission system (Manual or Automatic).
- **Owner**: The number of previous owners of the car.

### **Methodology**
The project follows a structured approach to data analysis and modeling:

1. **Data Understanding and Preparation**: Initial exploration and cleaning of the dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between features and the target variable (car price).
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features and encoding of categorical variables to enhance the predictive power of the model.
4. **Modeling**: Development and evaluation of various regression models to predict car prices. Models considered include Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Comparison of model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.
6. **Results and Discussion**: Analysis of model outcomes, identification of important features, and discussion of the insights gained from the study.
7. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings, potential improvements, and future work.

### **Significance**
Accurate car price prediction has significant implications for various stakeholders in the automotive industry. For buyers, it ensures fair pricing and helps in making informed purchase decisions. For sellers, it provides a competitive advantage by setting realistic price expectations. Additionally, the insights gained from this study can aid in understanding market trends and factors that heavily influence car prices.

By employing machine learning techniques, this project aims to bring objectivity and precision to the process of car price evaluation, ultimately benefiting the entire automotive ecosystem.
